        <h1>Bike World</h1>
        <h2>Infinite possibilities for bikers: That’s something you can hardly ever take quite as literally as on the sunny side of the Alps. 46 mountain bike and bicycle routes spanning a total of 950 kilometres in the Bike World make bikers’ hearts beat faster. From stunning scenic views of the Carnic, Gailtal and Julian Alps to refreshing dips in Lake Presseggersee or Lake Weissensee. And not to mention the sunny Mediterranean climate, the fresh mountain air and culinary stops that invite you to have a taste of Austria and Italy.</h2>
        <h3>Biking holiday guests have all the reason to get excited: Many of the routes not only run across Austrian terrain but all the way over to Italy. What’s more, bikers of all ages have a multitude of options to choose from. “Easy & Family”, “Tour & Trail” or “Enduro & Parks” – what’s it going to be for you? Choose your pick from the diverse possibilities – and experience your own personal bike adventure in the Nassfeld-Pressegger See region!</h3>
        <h4>The new routes with integrated trails connecting Austria and Italy aren’t the only surprising feature of the Bike World of the Carnic and Gailtal Alps. Besides the cross-border routes, the PAPIN bike rental system is yet another “nice surprise”. It allows you to rent your bike at any of the rental stations and return it anywhere as well. Just as surprisingly easy and convenient: bike transport by summer cable car or lift in the Nassfeld region and in Weissensee.</h4>
